# nlm-fake-ssg-site-NO-NLM
This repo is used to simulate actions SSGs do with media during Netlify builds - without an SSG.

This itself is to test Netlify Large Media's behavior under various conditions.

This is a repo which contains the template.

**DO NOT** activate Large Media for this specific repo. (It can be copied to make new repos which do install NLM for testing.)
