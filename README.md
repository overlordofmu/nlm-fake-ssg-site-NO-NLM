# nlm-fake-ssg-site-NO-NLM

## Purpose

This a template repo for testing Large Media's behavior under various conditions.

It simulates actions SSGs do with media during Netlify builds - without an SSG. Bash scripts are used to simulate and simplify the behavior of SSGs.


*delete this line and everything below after copying repo*

This repo is intended to be used as a template and does not have Large Media enabled yet.

Do not use this repo directly for Large Media testing. Copy it to a new repo and then install Large Media to test.

#### REMEBER: **Never** activate Large Media for this specific repo.

If you configure Large Media for this repo, it can no longer be used as a template.

This is because a single repo can only be linked to a single site's Large Media instance as mentioned in the [limitations](https://docs.netlify.com/large-media/requirements-and-limitations/#limitations) section of the documentation.
